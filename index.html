      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h4>Project 1: Portfolio Website</h4>
      <p>
       This project was a personal project in which I designed and developed a portfolio website to showcase my skills and past work.<br><br>The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is fully responsive, meaning it can be easily viewed on any device such as a laptop, tablet, or smartphone.<br><br>On the homepage, I included an introduction and brief overview of my skills and experience, along with links to my social media profiles and resume.<br><br>The main body of the website features a grid of thumbnails representing my past projects, each with a brief description and a link to a more detailed page featuring a full description of the project, as well as screenshots or a live demo.<br><br>I also included a contact form so that visitors can easily get in touch with me. Overall, this project allowed me to demonstrate my web development skills and create a professional online presence.

      <h4>Project 2: AR Web App for IBM</h4>
      <p>
      For this project, I worked as part of a team to create an augmented reality (AR) web app for IBM as a part of a university module. The app was designed to be an educational tool, allowing users to learn about different topics in an interactive and immersive way.<br><br>The app incorporated IBM Watson AI and text-to-speech technology to provide users with information about the topic in an engaging and accessible way.<br><br>We used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the app, and we also used a number of AR libraries and frameworks to create the AR experiences.<br><br>One of the key challenges we faced during this project was integrating the various technologies and ensuring that the app was user-friendly and intuitive for users. However, we were able to successfully overcome these challenges and deliver a functional and engaging app.<br><br>Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to work as part of a team and to learn about the latest technologies and techniques in AR and AI development. It also allowed me to showcase my skills in web development and problem-solving.
