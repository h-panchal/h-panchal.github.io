      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Hemal Panchal and I am currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and algorithms. I am also interested in exploring the intersection of technology and design, and I enjoy creating visually appealing user interfaces and web applications. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with new technologies and working on personal projects. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a software developer, and I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to meaningful projects.</p>
